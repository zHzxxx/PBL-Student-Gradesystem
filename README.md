# 📘 Student Grades Tracker (C++)

A simple C++ console application that tracks student grades by storing marks, calculating totals and averages, assigning grades, and displaying final results using arrays and functions.

---

## 📝 Project Overview

The **Student Grades Tracker** is a beginner-friendly C++ program designed to demonstrate core programming concepts taught in introductory programming courses. The application allows users to input student names and marks for three subjects, processes the data, and displays the academic results in a clear format.

This project focuses on practical implementation of arrays, loops, conditional statements, and functions without using advanced C++ features, making it easy to understand and explain during viva examinations.
